\section{Introduction}
This package defines a "BigMatrix" ReferenceClass which adds safety and convenience features to the filebacked.big.matrix class from the
bigmemory package. BigMatrix protects against segfaults by monitoring
and gracefully restoring the connection to on-disk data and it also
protects against accidental data modification with a filesystem-based
permissions system. We provide utilities for using BigMatrix-derived
classes as assayData matrices within the Biobase package's eSet family
of classes. BigMatrix provides some optimizations related to attaching
to, and indexing into, file-backed matrices with
dimnames. Additionally, the package provides a "BigMatrixFactor"
class, a file-backed matrix with factor properties.

<<introcode>>=
library(BigMatrix)
data.file = file.path(tempdir(),"bigmat","ds")
x = matrix(1:9,ncol=3,dimnames=list(letters[1:3],LETTERS[1:3]))
ds = BigMatrix(x,data.file)
ds[,1] = 3:1
ds[,1]

\section{Re-attaching to on-disk data as necessary}
When a big.matrix object is attached to it's on-disk data, an external
pointer is used to connect the R object to a C++ data structure. When
a big.matrix object is not attached, like when it is loaded from an RData
file, this pointer is nil. Any access to this nil pointer will crash
R. The BigMatrix package provides a BigMatrix class that prevents such
a crash by
controlling access to the external pointer. Additionally, BigMatrix
objects remember the location of their on-disk components and
automatically re-attach themselves as necessary.

This kind of thing would be helpful if you, for example, chose to save
your new BigMatrix object to disk for later use.  You might save your
object using R's built in save or saveRDS functions.

<<reattach>>=
ds$descpath
saveRDS(ds,file=file.path(tempdir(),"foo.rds"))
new.ds = readRDS(file=file.path(tempdir(),"foo.rds"))
new.ds[1:2,2:3]
@ 

\section{Files}
The bigmemory package creates two files for each object, and BigMatrix adds a
third. The bigmemory package creates one binary file for the matrix
data (the ``backingfile'') and one text file with meta-data about its
matrix (the ``descriptor'' file). The functions dget and dput are used to access
this meta-data. For large matrices with dimnames, this can take a
while. BigMatrix uses readRDS and saveRDS to store meta-data in a
third file, which requires about 1/10 the time to read when it's time
to attach an object to the backingfile. Use of a separate file allows access to the
on-disk data via big.matrix or BigMatrix objects.

\section{Limiting Write Permissions}
BigMatrix provides OS-level write permissions to the on-disk
data. With both big.matrix and BigMatrix, a user must always have read
and write permissions to the backingfile. BigMatrix uses the file system permissions on the meta-data
file, checking for write permission before allowing the user to alter
any of the on-disk data. This allows for a measure of safety when
BigMatrix data are used as a group resource.

<<writepermissions>>=
ds[1,1] = 5
Sys.chmod(ds$descpath,"0444")
tryCatch( { ds[1,1] = 10 }, error = function(e) { print(e) } )
Sys.chmod(ds$descpath,"0644")
ds[1,1] = 10
ds[,]
as(ds,"matrix")
@ 

\section{S4 Style Access}
The BigMatrix class uses R's Reference Class system. Any change to the
matrix portion of the data has on-disk side effects, so it seems
natural that any other changes to the object should have the same
behavior. In order to give BigMatrix the same API as a base matrix or
big.matrix class, certain S4-style methods are provided.
ReferenceClass objects are relatively new to R and unfamiliar to many
users, so you may want to review the ReferenceClasses help page.

<<S4methods>>=
nrow(ds)
ds$nrow()
ncol(ds)
ds$ncol()
dim(ds)
ds$dim()
dimnames(ds)
ds$dimnames()
length(ds)
ds$length()
@ 

\section{BigMatrixFactor}
The BigMatrix package adds a ``BigMatrixFactor'' class to provide a
means to store large matrices of characters. On the file system, these
are stored as the C type char or int (8 or 32 bits), depending on the number of
levels in the factor. Subsetting a BigMatrixFactor returns a base
matrix that is also a factor. This provides a convenient way to
convert between integer and character representations of the data.

<<factorcode>>=
data.file = file.path(tempdir(),"bigmat","fs")
x = matrix( c(rep(1,5),rep(2,4)) ,ncol=3,dimnames=list(letters[1:3],LETTERS[1:3]))
fs = BigMatrixFactor(x,data.file,levels=c("AA","BB"))
fs[,]
as(fs,"factor")
as(fs,"matrix")
fs$levels
levels(fs)
@ 

However, you may want to set the S3 class of this matrix/factor to
'matrix' in some cases, like when you need to maintain its shape.
<<factortricks>>=
x = as(fs,"factor")
x
x == "BB"
y = as(fs,"matrix")
y
y == 2
rowMeans( y == 2 )
@ 

\section{Use with Biobase and eSet-derived Classes}
Either class can be used as an assayDataElement in the assayData slot
of the familiar BioConductor eSet-derived classes. We provide utility
functions to deal with relocated BigMatrix files and to attach all of
an eSet's BigMatrix assayDataElements.  Of course, you can also just
let them attach themselves as necessary.

<<eset>>=
library(Biobase)
eset = ExpressionSet()
assayDataElement(eset,"exprs") = ds
exprs(eset)[1:2,2:3]

new.dir = file.path(tempdir(),"newbigmat")
dir.create(new.dir,showWarnings=FALSE)
file.copy(ds$descpath, new.dir)
file.copy(ds$datapath, new.dir)
updateAssayDataElementPaths( assayData(eset), new.dir )
assayDataElement(eset,"exprs")$descpath
attachAssayDataElements( eset )

\section{Optimal Usage}
Using dimension names can slow down access to a BigMatrix/big.matrix
object considerably.  Indexing into a big.matrix by dimname is
considerably slower indexing by integer.  BigMatrix has an
optimization to reduce this penalty.

Reading from a
BigMatrix/big.matrix with dimnames is also slower, as transferring
dimnames from big.matrix's C++ representation to R and adding them to
the numeric data from the matrix takes some time.  Typically, this
takes much more time than just reading the numeric data.

Future
optimizations may remove these penalties without changing the API, but when speed is critical,
you will want to avoid indexing by character values and you may want
to avoid having dimnames altogether.
