Version 0.1.8: [<- for BigFactorMatrix now converts incoming character value to integer

Version 1.3.1: Object creation functions BigMatrix and BigMatrixFactor can now optionally take a scalar numeric, like NA_real_ as the "x" argument. This will be used to initialize the matrix.

Version 1.4.0: Changed internal representation to optimize handling of dimnames and to eliminate the descriptor file. Be sure to use updateObject on any BigMatrix objects stored on disk. See the vignette for more details.

Version 1.4.1: Better defaults for initial value of BigMatrix and BigMatrixFactor (NA_real_ and NA_integer_).  Giving x=NULL still provides the bigmemory feature of initializing to all zeros instantly.

Version 1.4.2: BigMatrixFactor subsetting now just returns a character matrix. The previous factor with dim == 2 was a bit unpredictable and confusing for folks.
